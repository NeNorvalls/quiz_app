Here's a step-by-step guide to understand and implement the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code:

HTML Structure:

Start by creating an HTML file (e.g., index.html).
Inside the HTML file, create the basic structure with <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
Include necessary meta tags for character set and viewport.
Link an external CSS file (styles.css) to style the page.
Include a <div> element with a class of "container" to hold all the content.
Inside the container, create a <div> with a class of "question" to display questions.
Create another <div> with an id of "question-container" and a class of "hide" to contain answer buttons initially hidden.
Inside "question-container", create a <div> with an id of "answer-buttons" to hold the answer buttons.
Add two buttons for controlling the quiz ("Start" and "Next") with appropriate classes and IDs.
Finally, include a <div> with a class of "score" to display the user's score.
CSS Styling:

Create a CSS file (e.g., styles.css).
Style the container, question, answer buttons, controls, and score sections as per your design preferences.
Use classes and IDs defined in HTML to apply styles.
Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes if necessary.
JavaScript Functionality:

Create a JavaScript file (e.g., script.js) to handle quiz functionality.
Inside the JavaScript file:
Use document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {...}); to ensure the DOM content is fully loaded before executing the script.
Define variables to store elements retrieved from the DOM, such as start button, next button, question container, etc.
Initialize variables for storing shuffled questions and the current question index, and a variable to track the quiz score.
Add event listeners to the start button and next button.
Define functions to start the game, set the next question, display a question, reset the quiz state, handle answer selection, and set status classes for correct/wrong answers.
Include an array of questions, each containing the question text and an array of answer options with their correctness.
Implement Quiz Logic:

In the startGame() function, hide the start button, shuffle the questions, reset the quiz state, and display the first question.
In the setNextQuestion() function, check if there are more questions remaining, and if so, display the next question; otherwise, change the start button text to "Restart".
The showQuestion() function dynamically creates buttons for each answer option.
Implement logic to handle answer selection, update the score, and display correct/wrong feedback.
Update the quiz score display accordingly.
Testing and Debugging:

Test the quiz functionality thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
Debug any issues or errors encountered during testing.
Make necessary adjustments to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to improve the user experience and functionality.
Refactoring and Optimization:

Review the code for any redundancies or inefficiencies and refactor as needed.
Optimize the code for performance and readability.
Ensure compatibility with different browsers and devices.
